# MidtermProject

## Project Overview
For this project we worked as a team of four to build an original full stack web application. Our application allows users to create and manage a gift exchange or pot luck, which the creator can then invite others to join. Depending on the even type our application can randomly generate gifting assignments, but regardless all participants can create holiday wish lists with embedded links to purchase, update item status prevent double purchase, view other participants wishlists, anonymously comment on specific items, post recipes for the pot luck, comment on pot luck menu items, or just comment on a shared event wall.

Although this project had bumps along the way overall it progressed very smoothly mainly due to the pre-planing efforts we made as a team. We laid out and tracked our tasks, and their progress using Trello to host our kanban board. We also used Figma a wireframing tool to layout UI/UX, so we could visualize our pages before a line of code was ever written.

After getting our remote Git repository set up on GitHub. Our first task was building out our relational database using the MySQL Workbench and then populating it with a sufficient amount of test data for the JUnit Jupiter testing to come. With our database schema and mock data functioning we moved onto building out our JPA entities and mapping them to our database. As we built up the layers of functional mapping we utilized JUnit 5 to implement our test driven development (T.D.D.) practices. With fully tested database mapping we proceeded with building out our various .jsp views as well as writing our controllers to direct our "GET/POST" requests. From there we moved into full stack acceptance testing and styling our various pages with CSS.

## Lessons Learned
Planning and project management were essential in this project. Implementing agile practices allowed our team to maximize our productivity and minimize overlap. Utilizing Zoom and Slack to stay in constant communication with each other as well as utilizing task specific branches in git allowed us to maintain conflict free code while completely eliminating any slow downs in personal task progression. This also gave us good progress data to speak to each morning in our SCRUM meeting.
